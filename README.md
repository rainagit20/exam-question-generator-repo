# exam-question-generator-repo
This repository contains a machine learning project that fine-tunes a T5 model to generate fill-in-the-blank practice questions from French text. It supports DELF and TEF preparation by converting authentic sentences into structured exercises, with scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and reproducibility.
